Adding shell commands:

1. Create the method prototype in shell.h. My current convention is 
	void run_<command>( int argc, char **argv );
	
2. Create a stub in the shell.c's command_tab using the notation {"shellname", run<command>}, 
and increment command_count to match the number of commands in command_tab. 

3. Implement <command>.c file in the shell/ directory, ensuring that your method's main matches
the prototype you defined in shell.h
